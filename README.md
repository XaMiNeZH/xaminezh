About Me

Hey there! I'm a first-year Computer Science student with a passion for debloating, customizing, and debugging both Windows and Linux systems. I thoroughly enjoy discovering open-source projects of UI elements like Windows UI, Discord UI, and various web browsers.

Interests

    Debloating & Customizing: I love optimizing my system's performance by removing unnecessary bloatware and customizing its appearance to suit my preferences.
    Debugging: Troubleshooting issues on both Windows and Linux systems is something I find incredibly rewarding.
    Gaming on Low-End Hardware: Despite having a low-end laptop, I enjoy playing games like Fortnite, Apex Legends, CS:GO, R6S, and Payday. I'm always on the lookout for tweaks to optimize my gaming experience on such hardware.
    Discovering Open Source Projects: I have a keen interest in discovering and exploring open-source projects related to UI elements like Windows UI, Discord UI, and various web browsers.
    Playing Video Games: I'm an avid gamer and enjoy spending my free time playing video games.
    Football Enthusiast: I am a big fan of watching and playing football, especially the Premier League and Champions League.

Learning

    Currently diving into algorithms and Python as part of my Computer Science curriculum.
    Exploring more advanced topics on Windows and progressing from basics to aiming for an advanced level on Linux.
    Currently studying Math Sup - premier semestre:
        Logique et algèbre
        Analyse
        Algèbre et arithmétique
    In Math Sup - second semestre:
        Compléments d'analyse
        Algèbre linéaire et géométrie
        Probabilités

Tools & Environment

    I primarily use Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code for coding, especially for my university projects.
    Actively working on optimizing Windows for gaming and lightweight experiences.
